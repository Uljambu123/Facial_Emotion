# Emotion Classification Using CNN

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to classify human emotions from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset containing images labeled with different emotions and leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

## 2. Objective
- Develop a CNN model to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories.
- Improve classification accuracy using data augmentation and dropout layers.
- Utilize OpenCV for face detection and preprocessing.

## 3. Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset consisting of facial images categorized into emotions.
   - Resize and normalize the images.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Construct a CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense layers.
   - Use ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer.
   - Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Train the model for multiple epochs.
   - Monitor validation loss and accuracy to prevent overfitting.
   - Evaluate the model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

4. **Face Detection & Emotion Prediction:**
   - Utilize OpenCVâ€™s `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` to detect faces in images.
   - Preprocess the detected face and classify its emotion using the trained CNN model.

5. **Model Saving & Deployment:**
   - Save the trained model in `.h5` format for later use.
   - Load the model for real-time emotion classification.

## 4. Conclusions
- The CNN model successfully classifies emotions with high accuracy.
- Dropout layers and data augmentation helped reduce overfitting.
- The OpenCV-based face detection effectively extracts faces for emotion classification.

## 5. Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 6. Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet.
- Implement real-time emotion detection in videos.
- Integrate the model with a web application for accessibility.
- Enhance dataset diversity for better generalization.

## 7. How to Run
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python pandas matplotlib
```

### Steps to Run
1. **Train the Model** (if required):
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
2. **Run Emotion Detection:**
   ```bash
   python predict_emotion.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```
3. **Real-time Emotion Detection:**
   ```bash
   python real_time_emotion.py
   ```

The model will process the input image, detect faces, and classify the detected emotion.
